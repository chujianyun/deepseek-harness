# Desktop local update verification

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Local download and update-dialog evidence is separate from production backend integration, visual acceptance, and installed-application upgrades. Run the command in the [Desktop README](../README.md) to produce a fresh isolated report.

Installed qualification can opt into `DSH_DESKTOP_UPDATE_JOURNAL_DIR`, an absolute directory outside the installation tree that both versions retain. Each main process flushes a separate JSONL file with its installed version, state transitions, and manual-operation milestones. Raw diagnostics and request data are excluded; storage errors propagate. The [journal decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-14-desktop-installed-update-journal.md) defines evidence limits. Unit and main-entry tests cover the journal; a signed installed upgrade is still unverified.

## Native overlay visibility

On macOS, reuse the cached Electron runtime after compiling the Desktop Host sources:

```sh
pnpm exec tsc -b apps/desktop/tsconfig.host.json
apps/desktop/.desktop-build/targets/mac-arm64/electron/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron apps/desktop/tests/fixtures/update-overlay-visibility.mjs
```

The fixture owns a unique profile and writes `result.json` under `.desktop-build/qualification/update-overlay-*`. It compares native visibility, unfiltered parent content, and listener cleanup with the owner-local expected output for parent hide/show and document readiness while the parent is hidden. It uses no network, product login, or dsh Host. This qualifies native window restoration rather than the full first-login flow.

## Manual walkthrough

For actual installation, publication after startup, failure/retry, and restart evidence, use the [installed-update operator checklist](installed-update/README.md). The interactive runner below intercepts installation and is a different qualification.

With Host, client, and Desktop artifacts built, run `node --import tsx apps/desktop/scripts/test-workspace-updates.ts --interactive` from the repository root on Windows. The actual workspace stays open with a separate control window. Its menus hold and release downloads, inject download failures, and queue or clear test tasks. Select a failure before starting the download. After installation approval and task shutdown, a fixture message reports the intercepted installer call; acknowledging it ends the walkthrough. Closing the control window also exits. Each run owns a private profile and loopback server; payloads are not installers. Restart the command for a fresh round. Omitting `--interactive` runs the automated scenarios with their 120-second deadline and automatic exit; interactive downloads have a ten-minute network deadline.

## Evidence

The local command builds Desktop and executes Electron 44 with the actual HTTP updater, sandboxed preload, and ordinary dialog renderer. It records each scenario and preserves its report under `.desktop-build/qualification/local-updater-*`. The installer call is an observation substitute; downloaded bytes are not an executable installer.

Packaging supervision fixtures control their Git metadata and use real file hashes with inert child processes. Git-head and worktree changes still refuse packaging; concurrent tests cannot change the fixture’s recorded Git inputs.

| Layer | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Ordinary updater | Same/older-version rejection, user-authorized full download, SHA-512 rejection, interrupted transfer, stalled-feed/download deadlines, explicit retry, coalesced requests, same-address feed replacement, readiness, and separate install handoff pass |
| Ordinary scheduling | Fake-clock regressions with the real coordinator verify bounded jitter/backoff, manual joins, success reset, no automatic download retry, wall-clock independence, and disposal. Main-entry tests verify focus/resume throttling, immediate explicit checks, and quit cleanup |
| Actual ordinary dialog | Isolated preload, 380px card, 24px corners, black primary button, parent blur, Escape cancellation retaining readiness, and task-warning approval with recorded installation handoff pass |
| Main entry | Embedded legacy update-policy metadata is ignored without policy requests; installer failure after a clean stop and a confirmed non-graceful exit restore the current-version Host before another restart confirmation; a Host without confirmed process exit is never replaced |
| Host task protection | The actual controller with substituted composition detects running agents, queued turns/steps, and global and agent jobs; API reads do not warn. Admission locking returns 503 for new requests, drains existing requests, and rechecks tasks; unlock restores admission |
| Visible output | The ordinary update presentation expectation passes; account-row component tests cover progress and persistent retry |
| Packaging configuration | Metadata embeds the configured application ID and no update policy, even when legacy policy settings are supplied; the dotenv template rejects retired policy settings as unsupported |

The focused dialog, main-entry, presentation, overlay, and locale run passes 119 regression cases. The real-Electron command passes 16 scenarios and captures ordinary-ready and task-warning dialogs. These isolated checks do not certify the complete workspace or a release. Full-repository gate results and environment limitations remain separate from this focused evidence.

The [Desktop workspace browser scenario](../../web/tests/desktop-updates.e2e.ts) passes both Chinese and English cases, captures six screenshots per locale, and verifies bottom-row placement, compact progress with duplicate-click rejection, a top-toggle badge, persistent red retry with error tooltip, and a separate ready action. The presentation function, Host Web composition, client plugins, and CSS are real; the Desktop carrier is substituted. These cases do not exercise Electron IPC, menus, task authorization, or installation.

The [built Host scenario](fixtures/host-update-qualification.mjs) uses the actual profile Loader, standard agent preset, task services, and Node background processes. It verifies queued turns/steps, a running model request, pending questions/approvals, global and agent jobs in running/stopping states, admission locking without cancellation, restored admission, and rejected inspection after Host disposal. Only model responses and human answers are substituted. Two independent invocations pass concurrently with private profiles and session data; all owned agents, jobs, and Hosts finish before a success report is written.

The [Electron workspace runner](../scripts/test-workspace-updates.ts) executes a private copy of the compiled main entry with the real preload, workspace, and separate Host process. It acknowledges the first-run notice and drives renderer buttons through Electron input events and Chromium debugger input for the embedded Windows frame. The private application reuses the prepared target runtime resources. Seven scenarios pass, covering menu feedback, download failure and retry, separate installation confirmation, real confirmation-time task creation, deferral, and actual Host teardown timeout. A failed Host stop restores a replacement Host and requires fresh installation confirmation. Delivery uses a local server and installation is intercepted; these are not signed installed-app results.

The [Windows signature runner](../scripts/test-windows-update-signature.mjs) uses the installed electron-builder metadata generator and `NsisUpdater` verifier with the public release certificate and real executable inputs. Matching publisher attributes pass; the same valid signature with a different expected publisher and an unsigned executable are rejected. A missing-publisher negative control confirms that verification is skipped. Unit regressions cover DN escaping, incomplete identities, and explicit or host-default Windows targets; removing the publisher configuration fails both metadata cases. This check does not download, install, or sign an artifact.

The [signed-download runner](../scripts/test-signed-updates.mjs) connects real Electron HTTP, `NsisUpdater`, Windows Authenticode, and the built coordinator. Four scenarios pass: valid-hash wrong-publisher rejection, valid-hash unsigned rejection, corrupt-transfer rejection before signature verification, and explicit retry to signed readiness with separate installation handoff. Rejected executable caches are empty, automatic checks issue no retry request, prepared downloads are retained, and original inputs keep their SHA-512. The synthetic feed and test application adapter do not establish installed-version compatibility; no installer or Host starts.

With an old installer and both original blockmaps, the same runner additionally verifies single-range and multipart-range reconstruction, missing-old-blockmap fallback, and rejected-range fallback. Reconstructed executables pass SHA-512 and Authenticode checks. Request records distinguish differential payload bytes from full downloads; a full fallback cannot satisfy a differential-success assertion. These loopback results do not certify CDN Range support or an installed application's cache.

## Open verification

The following items are not passing evidence and must remain visible during review:

- Electron `capturePage()` captures individual windows. Windows interactive observations include composed dialogs and native menu selection, but cross-platform Figma/layout acceptance and a complete recording remain unverified. The automated workspace runner invokes the menu handler directly.
- The development launcher encounters a dangling optional Linux ARM64 dependency junction in this Windows checkout; the qualification runners link the existing dependency graph directly and do not validate that launcher's projection.
- The fixture does not execute an installer, overwrite an installed application, or establish that a new version starts successfully. Signed Windows and macOS installed-version qualification remains required for release.
- Two isolated Windows test installers pass signed-package inspection, including their embedded feed configuration. Installed startup, failure/retry, automatic restart, and data retention remain operator verification; file inspection does not certify a release.
- Updater feed and download stalls reach their real deadlines and recover. Injected download-write `ENOSPC` is covered; actual volume exhaustion and installed-upgrade disk pressure remain unverified. Differential download and publisher rejection are verified through real Electron downloads, but not yet in a newly packaged application's installed-upgrade path.
- Update failures use localized summaries and folded diagnostics. Ordinary error tooltips show summaries rather than raw diagnostics.
- Full `doc-sync` encounters Windows file-symlink `EPERM` in the documentation-site test. This is not an updater failure and does not make the full documentation gate green.
